            <p class="about-tittle">Michelle Bachelet Jeria</p>
            <p class='about-paragraph'>Is a Chilean politician who served as President of Chile from 2006 to 2010 and
                again from 2014 to 2018 for the Socialist Party of Chile, the first woman to occupy the position.
                <br><br>

                After leaving the presidency in 2010 and while not immediately reelectable, she was appointed the first
                executive director of the newly created United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of
                Women. <br><br>

                In December 2013, Bachelet was reelected with over 62% of the vote, bettering the 54% she
                obtained in 2006. She was the first President of Chile to be reelected since 1932. <br><br>

                In August 2018, the United Nations nominated her to become the next High Commissioner for Human Rights,
                replacing Zeid Raad Al Hussein. Bachelet, a physician who has studied military strategy at university
                level, was Health Minister and Defense Minister under her predecessor, Ricardo Lagos. Aside from her
                native Spanish, she also speaks, with varying levels of fluency, English, German, and Portuguese.
